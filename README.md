# traceleft

Detailed documentation can be found in [Documentation/](Documentation/).

## Quickstart

```bash
make
sudo build/bin/traceleft trace $PID1,$PID2:battery/out/handle_syscall_read.bpf $PID3:battery/out/handle_syscall_chown.bpf
```

The `$PID` is optional and can be skipped to load a handler as default handler.


## Tests

Test can be run with the following command:


```bash
sudo -E tests/run.sh
```

### Expected output

```bash
Using outfile /tmp/traceleft-test-cli-out-Ecw373
Using outdir /tmp/traceleft-trace-out
Running test_sys_chmod with PID: 7996               [PASSED]
Running test_sys_chown with PID: 8045               [PASSED]
Running test_sys_close with PID: 8099               [PASSED]
